# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Project guidelines

## Architecture

- `src/app` contains App Router routes, layouts, and route-specific UI.
- `src/components/shared` contains reusable application-wide components and providers.
- `src/components/ui` contains shadcn/ui primitives installed into and owned by this repository.
- `src/common` contains shared infrastructure and utilities that are not tied to a route.
- `src/db` contains the Drizzle client and PostgreSQL schema.
- `src/lib` contains configured library clients and framework integrations.
- Prefer the `@/*` alias for imports from `src`.
- Keep modules focused and colocate feature-specific code with its route or feature.

## Next.js and React

- Use Server Components by default. Add `"use client"` only when browser APIs, client-side state, or event handlers require it.
- Keep secrets, database access, and other server-only code out of Client Components.
- Use framework APIs and conventions documented in the installed Next.js guides.

## TanStack Query

- Use TanStack Query for client-side server state, caching, mutations, and hydration; prefer direct data access in Server Components when client caching is unnecessary.
- Use the shared `getQueryClient` from `src/lib/react-query.ts`; do not create ad hoc `QueryClient` instances.
- Keep the application provider in `src/components/shared/react-query-client-provider.tsx` and mount it around application children in the root layout.
- Use stable array query keys that include every input used by the query function.
- Prefer reusable query option factories when the same query is prefetched on the server and consumed on the client.
- Use `HydrationBoundary` with `dehydrate(getQueryClient())` for server-prefetched queries. Preserve the configured SuperJSON serialization.
- After successful mutations, invalidate or update every affected query explicitly.
- Keep React Query Devtools inside the shared provider and do not include its production entry point unless explicitly requested.

## UI and styling

- Use shadcn/ui with the `base-nova` Base UI preset configured in `components.json`.
- Add shadcn components with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>` and review every generated dependency and file change.
- Do not overwrite customized files in `src/components/ui` without explicit user authorization.
- Compose application-specific UI in route or shared component folders instead of adding product behavior to UI primitives.
- Use the `cn` helper from `src/lib/utils.ts` to merge conditional Tailwind classes.
- Prefer semantic theme utilities such as `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, and `border-border` over hard-coded colors.
- Preserve the theme tokens and shadcn imports in `src/app/globals.css` unless intentionally changing the application theme.
- Use Lucide icons through `lucide-react` and provide accessible labels for icon-only controls.
- Follow the installed Base UI component APIs; do not assume Radix UI props or composition patterns apply.

## Environment variables

- Define and validate environment variables in `src/common/env.ts` with Zod.
- Import the validated `env` object; do not access named `process.env` variables elsewhere.
- Add every required variable to `.env.example` with a safe placeholder value.
- Never commit real secrets or expose server-only values with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

## Database

- Use Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.
- Use camelCase names in TypeScript and snake_case identifiers in PostgreSQL.
- Define each schema object in its own `src/db/schemas/*.schema.ts` file and export it from `src/db/schemas/index.ts`.
- Generate migrations with `pnpm run db:generate` and commit the generated migration files.
- Do not apply migrations with `db:migrate` or `db:push` without explicit user authorization.

## TypeScript and validation

- Keep TypeScript strict and prefer inferred types when they remain clear.
- Validate untrusted input and external data with Zod at system boundaries.
- Prefer named exports for shared modules.
- Avoid `any`, unsafe casts, and non-null assertions unless their safety is established and documented.
- Return or throw actionable errors without logging secrets or sensitive values.

## Formatting

- Format source files with the repository Prettier configuration; do not hand-format against it.
- Use single quotes in TypeScript and JSX, omit semicolons, and keep trailing commas where supported.
- Let `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` order Tailwind classes using `src/app/globals.css`.
- Run `pnpm run format` after editing supported files and include formatting changes in the same task.

## Spec workflow

- When asked to create or update docs/specs, edit only documentation. Do not implement or commit. Stop for user review.
- Implement a spec only when explicitly requested. Follow the approved spec and project guidelines, update `docs/progress.md`, run required checks, and stop for user review.
- Use `docs/progress.md` as the source of truth when asked for current progress or next steps, especially in a new session. Read it first and avoid scanning unrelated files unless it is missing, stale, or insufficient.
- Never commit unless explicitly requested. When the user requests a commit, stage the relevant changes and commit without asking for separate confirmation.

## Commit messages

- Use Conventional Commits in the form `<type>(optional-scope): <description>`.
- Use one of these types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, or `revert`.
- Write the description in lowercase, imperative mood without a trailing period, for example `feat(auth): add password reset flow`.
- Choose the type based on the primary purpose of the commit; do not use `feat` for maintenance or tooling changes.
- Mark breaking changes with `!` before the colon and explain them in a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer when needed.
- Before creating a commit, review the staged diff and use a message that accurately summarizes it.

## Verification

- Run `pnpm run check` after code changes; it verifies formatting, ESLint, and TypeScript.
- Before creating a commit, run `pnpm run check` and only commit when it passes. If it cannot run or fails for an unrelated reason, report that clearly before committing.
- Run relevant tests when they exist or when a change adds them.
- Run `pnpm run db:generate` after schema changes and review the generated SQL.
- Report checks that could not be run and explain why.
